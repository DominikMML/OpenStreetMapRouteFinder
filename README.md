## General info
The rapid method for shortest path searching using undirected graphs with Open Street Map data.
 
# UndirectedGraphs

## Overview
This repository contains a method for finding the shortest path in undirected graphs using data from Open Street Map (OSM). The approach is demonstrated through a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Implementation of the shortest path algorithm for undirected graphs.
- Utilizes Open Street Map data for practical graph analysis.

## Files
- `Undirected_Graphs_Shortest_Path.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the shortest path algorithm.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries used: contextily, networkx, shapely

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DominikMML/UndirectedGraphs.git
    ```
2. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Undirected_Graphs_Shortest_Path.ipynb
    ```
